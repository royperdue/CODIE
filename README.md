# CODIE

Codie - is an artificial intelligence experiment that I made just to satisfy my own curiosity. The objective was to determine if a device could determine it's 
current location by recognizing objects in its surroundings. Conclusion; inconclusive.

Uses: Android SDK, Java, XML, TensorFlow Lite (machine learning models for mobile devices), Firebase, Google Cloud Vision api, REST, JSON, JavaScript, 
greenDAO (object/relational mapping library for SQLite).
